# Fonts

I can use Myriad Pro in Illustrator, but it seems like it is not available in other programs.
I downloaded Myriad Pro Regular from Fonts Geek: https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/Myriad-Pro-Regular
I used the Font Book app on mac. Clicked on My Fonts, then did Add Font to Current User and imported the ttf file
Now I see Myriad Pro Regular when doing ls -al ~/Library/Fonts
